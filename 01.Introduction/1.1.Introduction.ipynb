    "\n",
    "* Artificial Intelligence for Aviation Engineering\n",
    "* __3 ECTS__: about 80 hours of studies (24 contact hours)\n",
    "* The course is designed for undergraduate students of Aviation Engineering and requires knowledge of higher mathematics (linear algebra, optimisation) and programming skills (Python). Skills of data loading and manipulation (numpy and pandas linrary) are beneficial, but not a mandatory prerequisite.\n",
    "* Primary language - __<span style=\"color:#9D2235\">Python</span>__\n",
    "* Learning-by-doing approach – weekly practices\n",
    "* Assessment:\n",
    "    * Group Project and Viva (100%)"

    "\n",
    "* Assessment: Technical documentation on the group project + Presentation/Viva\n",
    "* Groups (teams) are formed by students and consist of 3 or 4 students.\n",
    "* Technical documentation is organized as the project portfolio - a repository of all intermediate and final project outputs and evidence of the team's processes and activities.\n",
    "* The project is concluded by the 15-minute Viva session that consists of a group presentation (10 minutes) and then questions from the tutors.\n",
    "* Each member of the team should be prepared to answer at least one question on an aspect of their project. Slides may be used but are not essential if the team prefers to present their work in another way.\n",
